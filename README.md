# Shell Scripts
---
This Repo is meant to become a collection of shell scripts I am writing or finished writing.

### rename_files
---
This script renames all files in a directory. Especially useful for bulk renaming of pictures and the like.
You can add a prefix or suffix to the filenames without changing the actual filenames, or you can rename the files with the same name. The script will number them in this case.

To start the script move into the folder with the script and type into the terminal:

./rename_script

This will start the script and let you choose what option to take when renaming files.
When the script asks for the directory where the files live which you want to rename you should give the script the absolute path not a relative path to the directory.


### system_information_script
---
This script shows some information regarding your machine.
You start the script by moving into the directory where the script is and typing:
./system_information_script
into the terminal.
